-TEST 1 BERT 
* The model is unable to detect sadness/anxiety, so for all sad emotions returns laughing. 
* Model is able to predict laughing emotion and sarcastic emotion accurately

-TEST 1 GPT 4.0
* The model was using keywords like electrifying or sunset to return the literal emoji
* Wasn't really predicting the "emotion" for most of them
* More accurate in finding out happy vs stressed/sad

-BERT MODEL (not pipeline)
1- Federated learning to train models for predicting emojis in text, which can help understand users' sentiments on social media. 
Federated learning allows decentralized training across multiple clients while maintaining data privacy. 
The paper describes the implementation of this approach in both clean data scenarios and attack scenarios (where data might be poisoned). 
The data for training and evaluation comes from Twitter and SemEval datasets.


* The label mapping used for this model is missing sad/anxious (negative) feelings
* Goal is to now learn to retrain model to become familiar with new emotions
